## What is Quikr ##
Quikr is a QUadratic, Iterative, K-mer based Reconstruction technique that
utilizes sparsity promoting ideas from the field of compressed sensing to
reconstruct the composition of a bacterial community (when the input data is
454-like pyrosequencing data). This extremely fast method comes with a default
training database but can be custom trained. Typically reconstruction is
accurate down to the genus level.
